Script name:		city2city.py

Python version: 3.7.6

Description:		After taking Quiz 2 of the edX "ColumbiaX: CSMM.101x Artificial Intelligence (AI)" course I wanted to
                have some practice on the different search algorithms (BFS, DFS, and UCS) which were used.
                Seeing as I've had much more practice working in Python and increasing the complexity of the scripts
                I've written, I wanted to try making one to solve the problem using the search methods taught.
                This is my script to specifically solve this puzzle using the 3 algorithms taught.
                I try to name my variables, lists, dictionaries, etc.. with useful names, comment A LOT, and explain
                my thought process so others looking at my code or even myself reading back over it can easily understand it.
                As of now (2020.02.29) I've completed the BFS and DFS sections, but I'm still working on the UCS algorithm.
